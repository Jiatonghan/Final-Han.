     Yesterday, I had a beautiful dream. Suddenly I returned to the yard of the grandmother in the country, which was filled with ancient peach trees. The branches were all next to each other, and they were covered with white flowers. I sat on the futon and held the tea. All the time, the flowers were slowly blooming. It‘s strange to say that every time I type a word on my mobile phone, it will follow.

I told her, can't you leave me, she walked over and leaned over my pillow, hugged me, my eyes were not sad. She, then I woke up, and it seemed that I had just finished the sentence and everything disappeared. This is about a month after she passed away. I wonder if she came back to see me or my image.

       I enjoyed the quiet of me and suddenly found a monkey, it was a lovely monkey. So I thought of my present, my parents are forcing me, turning me into jealousy, turning me into someone they want me to be, limiting my actions and destroying my dreams. I thought of death and wanted to commit suicide. So I thought that the monkey could kill me. So the monkey ran to me, the instinct made me dodge, so suddenly a person appeared behind him, and the monkey pressed his head in the flowers and plants. The face was facing my face, but his head was already worn by gravel and branches. Through, I am afraid, I am afraid of pain, afraid of being as ugly as he died. But I was wondering why there was no blood, so I blinked and his head began to bleed (why didn't have it before, I thought about it, maybe it was not enough imagination at the time). So I was even more afraid, afraid of pain, can my head not hurt? So I hid, but he was very long and almost reached me, so I told myself to wake up.

        When I was in high school, I went home for lunch, and I was going to sleep in the room for half an hour. When I fell too tired, I fell asleep, and then I couldn’t move my body. Suddenly I was awake and I could see the ceiling, but I knew that I was closed. The body is getting lighter and lighter, slowly getting on the body, and then a "beep" like a soap bubble from the body of the body (like the soul / spirit / consciousness jumped out).
        Floating in the air, I can see the bed's own body. I am very surprised. I am very conscious. The body is very light, almost no feeling, and I am not controlled. After I fumble, I start to control the direction slightly, but I can't open the door. Not the living room, so close to the wall, there is actually the ability to penetrate the wall, without any hindrance. When I drifted to the prescription and saw my mother cooking hard on the hot day, then I was surprised and under what circumstances I was screaming, I went back.      </p>

     I dreamed of a girl I knew but was not familiar with, and my brain cancer died in the past few years. It was the ex-girlfriend of my ex-boyfriend, and we have had some conflicts.

     There is no me in my dream, that is, I have no interaction with her. I already can't remember her face, but I know that that person is her. I don't know what the symptoms of brain cancer are and I have never known. In my dream, she held her head and looked at her face. I can't remember the details. Anyway, she is alone, it hurts, it must hurt. What I know is that all cancer patients are very painful before they die. I don't know what this dream is suggesting to me. I didn't go to the hospital to check my brain. I am sure that she is not so painful. However, this dream evokes my strong desire for survival. I am afraid that I will live a good life that day.

     I haven’t had a big drink for two days. My mental state is very poor, I am very unhappy, and my physical condition has not improved. I was anxious and shivering when I thought about leaving this thing, I was afraid, I wanted to have a hundred.</p>

      In a lively place that I have never seen before, it is a street machine shop, and it is very bright. I came to a big King of Fighters 98 arcade and watched it for a while. The man used the green energy of the grass, and the trick was to raise the dragon in the air. Then I voted for a coin and played against him. I was a little nervous. I only saw an icon of the Eight Gods I knew. I asked, where is the grass and the Mary, the man pointed it out to me, all I don’t know. icon. I chose the character into the game and found that I didn't have Mary, but the big snake. I chose the big snake in the top position and beat him very easily. During the process, my teeth have been bitten tightly and vigorously in a state of looseness (many times in my dreams), and the person said a few words to remind me that this may be a dream, so I hold him The collar asked him, although the specific words could not be remembered, but I succeeded in knowing the dream. Then I left the arcade hall, outside is a vast sea? I walked on the sea, (although I knew the dream, but the senses were still unclear) and then I tried to reach my head below the sea. This was a bad decision. The panic and suffocation in the subconscious caused me to wake up instantly. .</p>

When I went back, I watched the title of the test paper with my companions.
